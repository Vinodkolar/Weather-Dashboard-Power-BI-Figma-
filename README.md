The Weather Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project developed to analyze and visualize weather conditions across multiple locations. This project converts raw weather data into clear, actionable insights, making it easier to monitor and compare key metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

The process began with data collection from publicly available sources in CSV format. Data preparation was performed using Power Query, where missing values were handled, column names standardized, and data types corrected for consistency. A separate date table was created to support time intelligence functions and enable accurate trend analysis. Relationships were built between tables to allow smooth cross-filtering across different visuals.

The dashboard layout is designed for clarity and interactivity. A slicer panel allows users to filter by city, date range, and weather condition, making the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. KPI cards display essential metrics, including current temperature, average humidity, and total precipitation, giving an instant snapshot of weather conditions. Line charts visualize temperature and rainfall trends over selected periods, helping users identify seasonal patterns or extreme events. Bar charts compare weather metrics between cities, enabling quick benchmarking.

Additional features include conditional formatting to highlight extreme values such as heat waves or heavy rain, and tooltips that display detailed information when hovering over data points. These features improve the user experience and make the dashboard more insightful.

This project demonstrates key Power BI skills, including data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and the design of interactive visuals. It is particularly useful for sectors such as logistics, agriculture, and event planning, where weather conditions directly impact decision-making.

By presenting complex weather data in a simple, visually engaging way, the Weather Dashboard helps users quickly identify trends, track anomalies, and make informed decisions. It highlights the power of data visualization in turning raw data into meaningful information.
